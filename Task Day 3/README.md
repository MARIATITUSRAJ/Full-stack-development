1. Compare two JSON have the same Properties Without Order? 

The algorithm to compare two JSON documents works as follows. The function checks the type left and right document. When both sides are an object, the algorithm will collect the unique keys of both objects, and then iterate over those, checking whether the left and right property have the same value. When a property contains a nested object, the function will recursively compare these child objects.
